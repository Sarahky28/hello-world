# hello-world
In this project i will apply what I am learning at the CS50x.

Im Sarah, 16 years old and brazilian. I've never really felt connected with studying technologys or how they work but somehow last year they got  my attention and that's why im studying code right now. I do consider myself pretty funny and cool even tho this can sound a little narcisst, Im christian and really close to my familly. Im 100% sure knowing how to code can help me in the future so here I am. Hope I can visit Harvard one day.
